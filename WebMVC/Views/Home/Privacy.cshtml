    <div class="mt-4">
        <p>Welcome to the most exhilarating page on this student project - our Privacy Statement! If you've found yourself here, chances are you're either:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Really Bored:</strong> In which case, congratulations! You've discovered the hidden gem of our project. It's like finding a secret level in a video game, but with less action and more... well, privacy stuff.</li>
            <li><strong>A Privacy Enthusiast:</strong> We admire your dedication to understanding how your data is handled, even in the most obscure corners of the internet. Or maybe you just appreciate a well-crafted privacy policy. Either way, we salute you!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What We Do With Your Data:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Absolutely Nothing Exciting:</strong> Seriously, it's a student project. The most exciting thing we might do is use it to demonstrate a database query, and let's be honest, that's only exciting to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Homework Help:</strong> If your data shows you're great at coding, we might ask for help with our homework. Just kidding! (Unless...?)</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee Break Conversations:</strong> On a slow day, we might chat about who visited our project. Don't worry, it's all in good fun, and no names are mentioned. Mostly because we probably don't have your name.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cookies:</h3>
        <p>We're not talking about the chocolate chip kind, sadly. But if our site uses cookies, it's only to make things run smoothly. They're like the unsung heroes of the internet, working in the background, holding your virtual coffee while you browse.</p>

        <h3>The Serious Bit:</h3>
        <p>All jokes aside, we do respect your privacy. This project is for educational purposes, and we handle any data with care and confidentiality.</p>

        <p>So there you have it! Our privacy statement, where the biggest risk is dying of boredom. Thanks for stopping by, and remember, in the grand scheme of things, this is just a tiny student project in the vast cosmos of the internet.</p>

        <p>pls gib Z</p>
